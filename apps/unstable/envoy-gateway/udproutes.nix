For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same\nnamespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support\nand allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is\nnot applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\ncreate a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\nRoute.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\nresources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\nbe collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\nchoose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\ncase, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\nmerged.\n\nNote that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\nrules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\nallowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,\nGateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\ngeneric way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n\n\nParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are \"producer\"\nroutes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from\nany namespace to the Service.\n\nParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are\n\"consumer\" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound\nconnections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which\nthe intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a\nParentRef of the Route.";
